         <p>The goal of our visualization was to get a sense of where all of the time we spend on Youtube is going. More specifically, we wanted to see what type of videos we were watching (Gaming, Music, etc) and what channels we frequented the most. In addition, we wanted to see how this viewing pattern changed over time. We used the data Google provides as well as the Youtube API to grab done that wasn't initially given (data courtesy of Manav).</p>

         <p>Our visualization is split up into two parts: a Sunburst graph and a Steamgraph.</p>

       <div class="large-12 columns" style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
         <h2>Sunburst</h2>
          <div id="div2"></div>
       </div>
       <div class="large-12 columns">
           <p>The Sunburst graph is easiest read from the center outwards.</p>
           <p>The center represents the highest level division in our data, in this we are dividing the watch history by categories. The next layer outward represents a specific category. After that, specific channels from a category are shown, and finally videos from those channels.</p>
           <p>Hovering over a specific slice tells you what that slice represents.</p>

   <div class="row">

         <h2>Steamgraph</h2>

      </div>
      <div class="large-12 columns">
           <p>This streamgraph shows us the visualization of watching trends over time spread across channels.</p>
           <p>The different colors of the graph denote different channels and the rise and fall of the layers denote what proportion of time was spent on each channel at each timepoin.</p>
